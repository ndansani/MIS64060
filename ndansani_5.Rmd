## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cereals}
getwd()
cereals <- read.csv ("Cereals.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
cereals = cereals[-which(is.na(cereals$carbo)),]
	cereals = cereals[-which(is.na(cereals$potass)),]
	cereals
	

	# Make row names the names of the utilities, remove numerical labeling of rows
	row.names(cereals) <- cereals[,1]
	




	cereals <- cereals[,-1]
	cereals
	#removes mfr column
	cereals <- cereals[,-1]
	cereals
	#removes type column
	cereals <- cereals[,-1]
	cereals
	

	

	# normalize input variables
	# sapply changes everything to standardized numbers
	cereals.norm <- sapply(cereals, scale)
	

	# add row names to cereals
	row.names(cereals.norm) <- row.names(cereals)
	#you can only run the above line once; can't put row names once row names have already been established
	

	# compute normalized distance based on all variables
	d.norm <- dist(cereals.norm, method = "euclidean")
	

	

	

	# in hclust() set argument method =
	# to "ward.D", "single", "complete", "average", "median", or "centroid"
	

	# plot an empty scatter plot
	km<-kmeans(cereals.norm, 6)
	#there are 6 clusters
	

	plot(c(0), xaxt = 'n', ylab = "", type = "l", ylim = 
	       c(min(km$centers), max(km$centers)), xlim = c(0, 8))
	

	# label x-axes
	axis(1, at = c(1:13), labels = names(cereals))
	

	# plot centroids
	for (i in c(1:6))
	  lines(km$centers[i,], lty = i, lwd = 2, col = ifelse(i %in% c(1, 3, 5),"black", "dark grey"))

	text(x = 0.5, y = km$centers[, 1], labels = paste("Cluster", c(1:6)))
	

	#averages within clusters for each variable
	km$centers
	

	#distance between points within clusters
	km$withinss
	

	#how many data points are within each cluster is the size of the cluster
	km$size
	

	#1-6 clusters
	#wss is within sum of squares meaning the distance between points within each cluster
	#the higher the number of clusters, the lower the variance b/w points within clusters
	wss <- numeric(6)
	

	#mean of distance between points within a cluster vs number of clusters
	for (k in 1:6) wss[k] <- mean(kmeans(cereals.norm, centers = k, nstart = 25)$withinss)
	plot(1:6, wss, type="b",xlab="Number of Clusters", ylab="Within Sum of Squares")

	#SINGLE CLUSTER
	hc1 <- hclust(d.norm, method = "single")
	hc1
	

	plot(hc1, hang = -1, ann = FALSE)
	

	#the graph (dendrogram) shows us the shortest distance NY is to anything else is 3.6
	#closest Idaho and Puget are to anything else is 2.3
	

	cutree(hc1,k=6)
	#this shows just 6 clusters; number of clusters is 6 clusters
	

	cutree (hc1, k=10)
	#this shows 10 clusters
	

	#h will be cut the tree based on a number
	#if h is 3 then it clusters everything below 3 as one cluster and for everything above 3 will have their
	#own seperate cluster
	#COMPLETE CLUSTER
	hc2 <- hclust(d.norm, method = "complete")
	hc2
	

	plot(hc2, hang = -1, ann = FALSE)
	

	#the graph (dendrogram) shows us the shortest distance NY is to anything else is 3.6
	#closest Idaho and Puget are to anything else is 2.3
	

	cutree(hc2,k=2)
	#this shows just 2 clusters; number of clusters is 2 clusters
	

	cutree (hc2, k=5)
	#this shows 6 clusters
	

#The clusters for the healthy cereals should not be normalized. Finding the cluster with an array of healthy cereals would be the best option, so they can have a different option each day.

```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
