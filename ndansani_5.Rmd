## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
#1
x1 = total production rates for project 1
x2 = total production rates for project 2
x3 = total production rates for project 3

Objective Function - Max z = P - 6C - 3D
where: 
  
  Z = Non preemptive Goal Programming of various goals in long-term profit 
  P = total (discounted) profit over the life of the new products
  C = change (in either direction) in the current level of employment
  D = decrease (if any) in next year's earnings from the current year's level. 
 
constraints & definitions:

20x1 + 15x2 + 35x3 = P (profit objective function in millions $)
6x1 + 4x2 + 5x3 = 50 (employment in 100s of employees)
8x1 + 7 x2 + 5x3 >= 75 (earnings next year in millions $) 

penalties:

C = -6 -6
D = -3L
LP constraints:

y1 = 6x1 + 4x2 + 5x3 - 50
y2 = 8x1 + 7x2 + 5x3 - 75

Since y1 = y1+ - y1-
      y2 = y2+ - y2-

Sub new definitions for y1 and y2 back into the original constraints.
y1+ - y1- = 6x1 + 4x2 + 5x3 - 50
y2+ - y2- = 8x1 + 7x2 + 5x3 - 75

convert the constraints and P into LP format.

6x1 + 4x2 + 5x3 - (y1+ - y1-) = 50
8x1 + 7x2 + 5x3 - (y2+ - y2-) = 75
20x1 + 15x2 + 35x3 = P
xj >= 0, yk >= o, yk >= 0

#2
Convert the final objective function in terms of x1, x2, x3, y1+, y1- , y2+ and y2- and the penalties in management's goals.

Maximize Z = P - 6C - 3D

Max z = 20x1 + 15x2 + 25x3 - 6y1+ - 6y1- - 3y2-

All decision variables in the objective function
Max z = 20x1 + 15x2 + 25x3 - 6y1+ - 6y1- + 0y2+ - 3y2-
#3
Objective function - Max z = 20x1 + 15x2 + 25x3 - 6y1+ + -6y1- + -3y2-
ST:
6x1 + 4x2 + 5x3 - (y1+ - y1-) = 50
8x1 + 7x2 + 5x3 - (y2+ - y2-) = 75
  where, xj >= 0, yk >= o, yk >= 0

Max z = 20x1 + 15x2 + 25x3 + -6y1+ - 6y1- + 0y2+ + -3y2-
ST
6x1 + 4x2 + 5x3 + -1y1+ + 1y1- + 0y2+ + 0y2- = 50
8x1 + 7x2 + 5x3 + 0y1+ + 0y1- + -1y2+ + 1y2- = 75
  where, xj >= 0, yk >= o, yk >= 0
  
  There are seven decision.

```{r goal_programming}
library(lpSolveAPI)
lprec <- make.lp (2,7)
set.objfn(lprec, c(20,15,25,-6,-6,0,-3))
lp.control(lprec,sense='max')
add.constraint(lprec, c(6,4,5,-1,1,0,0),"=",50)
add.constraint(lprec, c(8,7,5,0,0,-1,0),"=",75)
set.bounds(lprec, lower = c(0,0,0,0,0,0,0), columns = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7))
ColNames <- c("rate_of_project1", "rate_of_project2", "rate_of_project3","penalty_positive_change_level_of_employment", "penalty_negative_change_level_of_employment", "penalty_positive_change_level_of_next_year_earnings", "penalty_negative_change_level_of_next_year_earnings", "non-negativity_constraint", "non-negativity_constraint", "non-negativity_constraint", "non-negativity_constraint", "non-negativity_constraint", "non-negativity_constraint", "non-negativity_constraint", "non-negativity_constraint", "non-negativity_constraint")
rownames <- c("current_level_employment","next_year_earnings")
lprec
write.lp(lprec, filename = "Emax_Corporation_goal_programming_problem", type = "lp")
solve(lprec)
get.objective (lprec) 
get.variables (lprec)
```
The non-preemptive goal programming of various goals in long-term profit is 225 million. This was solved using the shortcut method. 
250 employees should be added to keep the same amount of profit margins in the next year. THe employment target is exceeded by 25% based off of the 2500 employees.  Profit = 20x1 + 15x2 + 25x3 = 20(0) + 15(0) + 25(15) = 375 million dollars excluding training and acquisition costs associated with bringing on new employees. 

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
